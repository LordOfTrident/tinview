Pre-compiled and copied from https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp because I didn't want a copy of
such a big repository in tinview. It also compiles examples and their makefile doesnt provide a way
to disable that as far as I know.

To compile it yourself, use:

$ git clone https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp
$ cd libwebp
$ make -f makefile.unix

And then copy these files to this folder:

- src/libwebp.a
- src/webp/*
